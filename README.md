1. **Stacks** 📚 
   - A linear data structure where elements are added and removed from the same end (LIFO - Last In, First Out).
2. **Queues** 🎟️ 
   - Another linear data structure, but with FIFO (First In, First Out) behavior.
3. **Priority Queues** 🥇
   - A variation of queues where elements have assigned priorities.
4. **Linked Lists** 🔗 
   - A dynamic data structure where elements (nodes) are connected via pointers.
5. **Dynamic Arrays** 🌱 
   - Arrays that can grow or shrink dynamically as needed.
6. **LinkedLists vs ArrayLists** 🤼‍♂️ 
   - Comparing linked lists and arrays (lists) in terms of performance and use cases.
7. **Big O notation** 📈 
   - Describing algorithmic complexity in terms of time and space.
8. **Linear search** ⬇️ 
   - A simple search algorithm for finding an element in a list.
9. **Binary search** 🪓 
   - Efficiently searching a sorted list by dividing it in half repeatedly.
10. **Interpolation search** ❓ 
    - A variation of binary search that estimates the position of the target element.
11. **Bubble sort** 🤿 
    - A basic sorting algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements.
12. **Selection sort** 🔦 
    - Sorting by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element.
13. **Insertion sort** 🧩 
    - Building a sorted list by inserting elements one at a time.
14. **Recursion** 😵 
    - Solving problems by breaking them down into smaller, similar subproblems.
15. **Merge sort** 🔪 
    - A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.
16. **Quick sort** ⚡ 
    - Efficiently sorting by partitioning the array.

    - Storing graph information in a matrix.
20. **Adjacency list** 📑 
    - Representing graphs using linked lists.
21. **Depth First Search** ⬇️ 
    - Traversing graphs by exploring as far as possible along each branch.
22. **Breadth First Search** ↔️ 
    - Exploring a graph layer by layer.
23. **Tree data structure intro** 🌳 
    - Hierarchical structures with nodes and edges.
24. **Binary search tree** 🔍 
    - A binary tree with specific ordering properties.
25. **Tree traversal** 🧗 
    - Visiting nodes in a tree in a specific order.
26. **Calculate execution time** ⏱️ 
    - Measuring how long an algorithm takes to run.
