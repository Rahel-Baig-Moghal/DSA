# **Linked Lists**

- A linked is a linear data structure that consists of a series of nodes connected by pointers.
- Each node contains data and pointers/reference to the next node in the list.

### Properties
- Non-contiguous[The nodes do not have to be stored contiguously right after each other like elements are stored in arrays.]
- Typically allocated one by one to individual elements.
- Effiecient insertion and deletion.
- Sequential access.
